**How to convert statistics from \(P\), \(LSD\), or \(MSD\) to \(SE\)**

Many statistical transformations are implemented in the [transformstats](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/master/utils/R/transformstats.R) function within the PEcAn.utils package. However, we have not yet automated some transformations that require detailed knowledge of the experimental design that is not captured in the BETYdb schema. Additional details and examples are found in the ["Transformations of ANOVA and Regression statistics for Meta-analysis"](https://www.authorea.com/users/5574/articles/6811/).
