# Entering Meta-Data

Before entering your trait data, you must first add associated metadata into BETYdb.

Each data point should have an associated experiment, site, treatment, and citation. Each site should be associated with a cultivar.

There are a few methods in which metadata may be entered into BETYdb. Avaialble methods include the BETYdb web interface, BETYdb-YABA and its python client, or SQL and R. Each method has a different use case. 

The web interface can be used when you need to add a few records to each table, while the BETYdb-YABA and its python client should be used when there are a large amount of records to add to each table. SQL and R can also be used to upload a large amount of records. However, these tools should primarily be used when you need to fix an error with your data, or when your metadata addition requires a feature that is not avaiable through the web interface or BETYdb-YABA.
