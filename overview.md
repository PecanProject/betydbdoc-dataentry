# Entering Meta-Data

There are a few methods in which metadata may be entered into BETYdb. Avaialble methods include the BETYdb web interface, BETYdb-YABA and its python client, or SQL and R. Each method has a different use case.

Before entering data, it is first necessary to add and select the
citation that is the source of the data. It is also necessary for each
data point to be associated with a Site, Treatment, and Species.
Cultivar information is also required when available, but it is only
relevant for domesticated species. Fields with an asterisk (*) are
required.
