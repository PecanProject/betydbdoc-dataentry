# Entering Meta-Data

Before entering your trait data, you must first add associated metadata into BETYdb.

Each data point should have an associated experiment, site, treatment, and citation. Cultivar information is also required when available.

There are a few methods in which metadata may be entered into BETYdb. Avaialble methods include the BETYdb web interface, BETYdb-YABA and its python client, or SQL. Each method has a different use case. 

The web interface can be used when you need to add a few records to each table, while the BETYdb-YABA and its python client should be used when you would like to perform an automated bulk upload to many tables. SQL can also be used for bulk uploads. However, SQL should primarily be used when you need to fix an error with your data, need to remove duplicate records / replace records, or when your metadata addition requires a feature that is not avaiable through the web interface or BETYdb-YABA.
