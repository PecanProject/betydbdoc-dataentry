##  BETYdb: Bulk Data Upload

Currently the web interface does not support bulk data upload, although
this is a planned feature for BETY 2.0.

For bulk data upload, or for a complete view of the tables in BETY, a
blank spreadsheet can be found
[online](https://spreadsheets0.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en&hl=en&key=0Ai_PDCcY5g2JdFN1UDJJdjNsZk9RM0Z6bnFDdlQ0clE&output=html)
and can be downloaded in .xls format
[spreadsheet](https://spreadsheets0.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en&hl=en&key=0Ai_PDCcY5g2JdFN1UDJJdjNsZk9RM0Z6bnFDdlQ0clE&output=xls).
Contact [David LeBauer](mailto:dlebauer@illinois.edu) or [Mike
Dietze](mailto:mdietze@illinois.edu) for more information about using
this method of data upload.
