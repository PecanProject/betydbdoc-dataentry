## BETYdb-YABA and Python Client Library

BETYdb-YABA and its python client library provides an automated bulk upload to many BETYdb tables. For more information, see the BETYdb-YABA [README](https://github.com/PecanProject/BETYdb-YABA/blob/master/README.md)

BETYdb-YABA requires that you run curl commands on the command line, while the python library allows you to simply call some functions to add your metadata.
